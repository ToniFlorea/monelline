Tortellini with pumpkin, ricotta or ragu, tagliatelle or gnocchi - all are hand-crafted in the 'Le Monelline' kitchen, just as my grandmothers were preparing them. I learned to make pasta dough from my grandmother, Triestina and my mother Ilde, who also taught my wife Tünde. Homemade Pasta, from quality ingredients, are good, healthy, full of love and the energy needed to produce them.”",

With love and curiosity, we have reinterpreted the traditional Italian recipes for new flavors, textures and tastes, in modern notes. Traditional pasta with typical Emilian sauces such as ragu, butter and sage, parmesan cream - or unprecedented combinations such as the surprising Black Sepia Monelline with salmon in citrus sauce, all made with the highest quality ingredients, with maximum care for preparation and delivery. ”',
